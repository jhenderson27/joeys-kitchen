    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A good infinity pizza isn't really about the ingredients at all, we're going for quantity over quality here. Whatever you can scrape together for toppings will work, I just happened to have some locally sourced organic free range low sodium gluten free pepperoni on hand when writing this recipe up so that's what I used.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>1 pizza dough ball</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Red sauce</li>
        <li>Toppings!</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450Â°</li>
        <li>Toss or roll the dough out into a circle</li>
        <li>Spread the sauce (doesn't really matter how close you get to the edge here since we're going for an infinity pizza there won't actually be an edge when we're done)</li>
        <li>Add the cheese</li>
        <li>Add the toppings</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the crust starts to crisp</li>
        <li>Hit the infinitizer switch</li>
      </ol>

<p>There you have it! </p>
