I've never really built a website from scratch before. This is my first attempt at doing so by following the foundations course at https://www.theodinproject.com/

After using google image search to find some pictures, I decided to go with satirical recipes instead of anything serious.

If anyone actually reads this, I hope you got a little chuckle out of it at least!
